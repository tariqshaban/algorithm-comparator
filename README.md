Algorithm Comparator
==============================
This is a submission of **assignment 3** for the **CIS711** course.

It contains the code necessary to conduct tests among selected algorithms and determine the most efficient algorithm.

This repository is merely a demonstration of how to perform statistical tests.


Getting Started
------------
Clone the project from GitHub

`$ git clone https://github.com/tariqshaban/algorithm-comparator.git`

Install numpy
`pip install numpy`

Install pandas
`pip install pandas`

Install scipy
`pip install scipy`

Install tabulate
`pip install tabulate`

Install statsmodels
`pip install statsmodels`

You may need to configure the Python interpreter (depending on the used IDE)

No further configuration is required.
